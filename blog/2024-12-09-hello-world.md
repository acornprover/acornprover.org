Good news, everybody!

With this blog post, I hereby demonstrate that the Acorn blog is now capable of handling posts.

To give a brief overview, the current state of Acorn is "not yet ready for public consumption". You can [get the Acorn code from GitHub](https://github.com/acornprover/acorn) to build it yourself, or you can [browse the Acorn standard library](https://github.com/acornprover/acornlib) to get a sense of the language, but the sane distribution channels aren't entirely hooked up yet.

We'll be ready for private beta real soon now. Just a few more little details to touch up. Stay tuned!
