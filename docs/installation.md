# Installing Acorn

The primary way to use Acorn is through the Acorn Prover VS Code extension.
It works on Windows, Linux, or modern Macs with an M-something chip.

## Installing the VS Code Extension

First, [download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), if you don't have it already.

Then, install the Acorn Prover extension. You can do this from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=acornprover.acornprover), or from the VS Code extensions side panel.

## Checking That It Works

Open up VS Code and make a new Acorn file. An Acorn file has to end with a `.ac` extension, so save this new file as `hello.ac`.
You can make a new folder for the project, or just stick this file anywhere.

Once you save this file, the Assistant window should appear.

Once the Assistant window appears, you're ready to go. Check out [the tutorial](/docs/tutorial/proving-a-theorem/) to learn more about Acorn.
