# Basic Syntax

Acorn is a line-oriented language. Usually, you write one thing on one line, then continue on to the next line.

Sometimes, code is grouped into blocks. These are delineated with `{ ... }` braces, and sometimes keywords to connect subsequent blocks. Inside the blocks, it's one thing per line.

Comments start with `//` and extend through the rest of the line.

For example:

```acorn
// Here's an if-else
if foo {
    bar
} else {
    baz
}

// Here's a theorem
theorem foo {
    bar
} by {
    baz
}
```

Line breaks inside parentheses or after infix operators are ignored, which you can use to split a statement among multiple lines if you want.

## Expressions

An expression in Acorn is either a named value, or a way of building one value out of other values. Here are some examples.

```acorn
true

false

1

1 + 1

(1 + 2) + 3

foo(bar, baz, qux)
```

## Types

Acorn has strong, static typing. Every expression has a type.

Variable names start with a lowercase letter. Type names start with an uppercase letter.

Function types can be defined based on their argument type and return type:

```acorn
// Functions that take a natural number and return another, like "successor"
Nat -> Bool

// This is the type of comparison operators, like "less than"
(Nat, Nat) -> Bool
```

The only type defined in the Acorn kernel is `Bool`, along with the values `true` and `false`.

## Statements

Acorn is a statement-based language. Sometimes, a statement requires a proposition to be proven. A statement can also introduce a proposition, which can be used to prove subsequent things. These may or may not be the same proposition.

If you write an expression by itself on a line, that counts as a statement. The expression must have `Bool` type, and the statement is the proposition that this expression is always true.

## Philosophy of Proofs vs Types

The "Curry-Howard correspondence" is a famous and profound connection between logic and computation. The Curry-Howard correspondence shows how each logical proposition can be viewed as a type in a programming language, a proof can be viewed as a program of the associated type, and proof normalization can be viewed as program execution. It is beautiful. A diamond-like jewel.

Acorn does not use the Curryâ€“Howard correspondence.

In Acorn, proofs and types are fundamentally different things. The Acorn verifier runs in two phases: first compilation, then proving. This makes it very natural to express "incomplete proofs" in Acorn. An incomplete proof is one where typechecking works, but proving doesn't work.

An incomplete proof is the ideal artifact for a human to share with an AI. The human has done some work, but it would be really nice if the AI could take it from here.
