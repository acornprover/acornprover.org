The first is _typeclasses_.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n```acorn\\ntypeclass S: Semigroup {\\n    // Semigroups have a binary operation\\n    op: (S, S) -> S\\n\\n    // The operation must be associative\\n    associative(x: S, y: S, z: S) {\\n        x.op(y.op(z)) = x.op(y).op(z)\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nA typeclass lets you prove things about many types at once. You can prove theorems about group theory, and then later apply them to any group. Groups, rings, fields, metric spaces, vector spaces, many mathematical concepts are naturally represented by typeclasses.\\n\\nFor more information, see the [typeclasses documentation](/docs/language/typeclasses/).\\n\\nThe second improvement is _generic inductive types_.\\n\\n```acorn\\ninductive List<T> {\\n    nil\\n    cons(T, List<T>)\\n}\\n```\\n\\nGeneric inductive types are another way to let you prove theorems about a general type, and apply them to others. Many \\"container\\" sorts of objects like lists, finite sets, or multisets are naturally represented by generic inductive types.\\n\\nThe Acorn AI has been updated as well, so it knows how to prove theorems using the new type system. Give it a try! Installing Acorn is as easy as [downloading a VS Code extension](/docs/installation/).\\n\\nIf you run into any bugs or have any questions, let us know in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RqXxaye4MC).

Usually this works great, but this can make refactoring more difficult. In particular, if you make changes to a module like `nat.ac` that many other modules depend on, it can be slow to rebuild everything. If you want to remove a theorem that is used in many places, this can involve many slow rebuilds.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThe build cache mostly solves this problem. Instead of discarding the detailed proof after finding it, Acorn now saves build artifacts in a `build` directory of the library. While testing, this speeds up partially-cached refactoring operations like renames by a factor of roughly 10x.\\n\\nThese build artifacts are somewhat human-readable, for the curious. In particular, it can be interesting to see the dependencies between theorems. These make up most of the build cache, as premise selection is the vast majority of the work of the prover:\\n\\n```\\n  add_from_int:\\n    rat:\\n    - add_int_eq_int_add\\n    real:\\n    - Real.from_int\\n    - add_from_rat\\n```\\n\\nFor the most part, though, you won\'t notice anything visibly different with Acorn 0.0.8. Everything should just be faster, and work the same way you\'re used to.
