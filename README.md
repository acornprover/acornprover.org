# acornprover.org

The main website for the Acorn theorem prover.

The website is built with the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) framework, which is designed for documentation websites. It's pretty easy to add new documentation, or to edit the documentation - you're
basically just editing Markdown files.

If you've made changes and want to see them locally, run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Please feel free to contribute pull requests! It's especially helpful to add documentation when you add new components to the standard library.
